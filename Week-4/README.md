# Week 4 – Advanced Penetration Testing & Exploitation

## Overview
Week 4 focuses on advanced offensive security concepts, including exploit chaining, custom exploit development, defense evasion, and full-scope vulnerability assessment.  
The tasks in this week simulate real-world penetration testing engagements using industry-standard tools and methodologies.

All activities follow a structured approach aligned with the **Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES)**.
